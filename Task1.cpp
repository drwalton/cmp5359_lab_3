// The goal for this lab is to draw a triangle mesh loaded from an OBJ file from scratch.
// This time, we'll draw the mesh as a solid object, rather than just a wireframe or collection
// of vertex points.
//
// *** Your Code Here! ***
// Task 1: As with last week, this is actually in the header files - this time we'll need both 2D and 3D vector classes!
//         Implement the dot and cross products in Vector2.hpp and Vector3.hpp so we can use them to draw our mesh.

	image[pixelIdx * 4 + 3] = a;

// described in the slides. I've broken down the steps involved here in comments added to the function.

	// (that is, find minX, minY and maxX, maxY that are the min and max x and y-coordinates present in the triangle)
	// You can use the std::min and std::max functions if you wish.
	
	// YOUR CODE HERE
	int minX = 0, minY = 0, maxX = 0, maxY = 0;

	// Check your minX, minY, maxX and maxY values don't lie outside the image!
	// This would cause errors if you attempt to draw there.
	// That is, clamp these values so that 0 <= x < width and 0 <= y < height.

	// YOUR CODE HERE

	// Find vectors going along two edges of the triangle
	// from p0 to p1, and from p1 to p2.

	// YOUR CODE HERE
	Vector2 edge1, edge2;

	// Find the area of the triangle using a cross product.
	// Optional: You can use the sign of the cross product to see if this triangle is facing towards
	// or away from the camera. If you avoid drawing the triangles that face away, this may improve 
	// the quality of your render. (Note this optional feature is backface culling, one of the requirements
	// for your coursework!)

	// YOUR CODE HERE

			// Find the area of each of the three sub-triangles, using a cross product
			// YOUR CODE HERE - set the value of these three area variables.
			float a0;
			float a1;
			float a2;

			// Find the barycentrics b0, b1, and b2 by dividing by triangle area.
			// YOUR CODE HERE - do the division and find b0, b1, b2.
			float b0;
			float b1;
			float b2;

			// Check if the sum of b0, b1, b2 is bigger than 1 (or ideally a number just over 1 
			// to account for numerical error).
			// If it's bigger, skip to the next pixel as we are outside the triangle.
			// YOUR CODE HERE
			float sum;

			// Now we're sure we're inside the triangle, and we can draw this pixel!

		// This is a bit boring. Try replacing this code to draw two different bunny types.

		// Bunny 1: Random Colour Bunny
		// Assign a random colour to each triangle in the bunny. You can do this by making use of 
		// the rand() function in C++.
		// Hint: Remember rand() returns an int, but we want our colour values to lie between 0 and 255.
		// How can we make sure our random r, g, b values stick to the right range?

		// Bunny 2: (Sort of) Diffuse Lighting Bunny
		// For the final task we'll do a bit of a preview of session 5 on diffuse lighting.
		// The idea here is that we colour each triangle according to how much it points towards the camera.
		// 
		// To do this, first find a vector pointing out at 90 degrees from the triangle, and normalise it
		// This special perpendicular vector is called the triangle's *normal*.
		//
		// Once you have your normal, take the dot product with (0,0,1). This will effectively measure how much
		// the normal points down the positive z-axis.
		// Use this value to set the brightness of the triangle (remember to scale it back to the [0,255] range).
